> *Disclaimer* :  This syllabus has been made by referring to Harkirat Singh's 
videos and Cyfrin Updraft's course content. It is not my creation but 
it is something that I am following in my Web3 journey.

## Motivations and Demotivations
- Fairly new technology with interesting use-cases
- High paying REMOTE jobs
- Lack of talented / experienced engineers in the ecosystem
- High bounty hackathons
- Very interconnected ecosystem. Easy to reach out to people

- Major parts of the ecosystem feels "scam-ish"
- Might or might not have a future in India after the WazirX hack incident!
- Would not overlap with almost any college course

## Pre-requisite
Some programming experience. Client-side Web3 would assume that you have 
experience with writing `JavaScript/TS` and have basic understanding of `Node.js`

## -- Client Side Web3 (not in particular order)
1. General
  - Introduction to blockchains, decentralization, BTC, ETH, and SOL
  - Basic cryptography : understand hashing, private and public keys
  - Gas Fees, Native Tokens, Transactions, Programs, Instructions, Block explorer
    airdrops, creating wallets
  - Common RPC methods on Solana and Ethereum

2. Solana 
  - Creating tokens, attaching metadata
  - Wallet adapters
  - Creating `Metaplex` NFTs
  - Solana on the backend with `@solana/web3.js`
  - `Solana` with `Next.js`

3. Ethereum
  - Understand proof of stake
  - EVM Architecture, State, Bytecode, Opcodes, ABIs, EOAs vs Contract accounts
  - Wallet adapters in ETH
  - ETH with React and Next.js
  - ETH on server-side with `ether.js`

## -- Contracts Side Web3 (not in particular order)
1. Solidity Basics (Remix IDE)
  - What are contracts ?
  - Solidity builds, ABIs, binaries and EVM
  - Storing state, variables, types, visibility (public/private) loops
  - Language constructs : arrays, structs, mappings, inheritence, events
  - Gas Optimizations, Native payment support, Interfaces and CPIs
  - Sepolia test network :: smart-contract `deployment`

2. Solidity Advanced
  - Introduction to ganache, truffle and foundry
  - Writing contracts in Foundry, setting up and testing projects locally
  - Proxy contracts (ERC20, ERC 720)
  - Upgradable contracts
  - Marketplace contracts
  - Testing contract locally, deploying using foundry
  - DEX, AMM, liquidity pools and constant product algorithm
  - Exploring open zepplin contracts
  - Staking in lieu of tokens

3. Rust 
  - Common programming constructs
  - Memory model: Ownership, borrowing, referencing
  - Options, Errors, Error handling
  - Lifetimes, Traits, generics, multi-threading
  - Concurrency, Iterators and Macros

5. Misc :
  - Private key management (Shamir Secrets)
  - Indexing blockchains 
  - Transaction parsing
  - Sweeping wallets, new wallet creation logic
